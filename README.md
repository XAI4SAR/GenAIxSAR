## Experiments

We provide several baseline models based on GAN for multi-view SAR target image generation under limited observation angles. The source code can be found at ./GAN

### Method

The baseline models are based on ACGAN, utilizing class label $y$ and azimuth angle $\theta$ as conditional inputs. The discriminator not only differentiates whether the input image is true or false, but also predicts the class label and azimuth angle of it. Furthermore, in order to stabilize the training process, we adopt the following techniques respectively:
+ SNGAN([Spectral Normalization for Generative Adversarial Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.05957))
+ LSGAN([Least Squares Generative Adversarial Networks](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_ICCV_2017/papers/Mao_Least_Squares_Generative_ICCV_2017_paper.pdf))
+ DRAGAN([On convergence and stability of gans](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.07215))
+ WGAN-GP([Improved Training of Wasserstein GANs](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2017/file/892c3b1c6dccd52936e27cbd0ff683d6-Paper.pdf))

### Getting started

#### Datasets
MSTAR dataset is used in the experiment. The dataset contains ten different classes of vehicles with azimuth angle ranging from 0° to 360°.

#### Training
To train a GAN model, run the following command:
```
python train.py \
   --bs 32 \
   --lrg 0.0001 \
   --lrd 0.0001 \
   --num_epochs 500 \
   --save_dir ${SAVE_PATH} \
```
+ lrg and lrd are the learning rate of the generator and discriminator respectively
#### Generating 
After training stage, run the following command to generate SAR target images with given label and angle information corresponding to a 15◦ depression angle.
```
python generate.py
```
